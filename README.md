https://www.fintechee.com/features/fix-api-bridge/

If you are using our FIX API trading platform individual/bridge version(no matter whether it's a paid version or free version), you need to put the "json" folder in the root directory of the FIX API trading platform.

```
root
│───fixprox-6.0.jar
|───json
│   └───symbols.json
|───webcontent
│   └───js
│       |───cc
│       |   └───lang
│       |       |───en.js
│       |       └───cn.js
│       |───brokers.js
│       |───builtin.js
│       |───cpp.js
│       |───d.js
│       |───o.js
│       └───u.js
│───util.cfg
└───calendar.csv
```

### Please don't change the names and the folder structure of the files.

### Please replace the "lpName" of the Json object with the specific name.

Adaptive lpName:

* b2brokerdata.cfg
* cmcdata.cfg
* scopemktdata.cfg
* exantedata.cfg
* advmktdata.cfg
* lmaxdata.cfg
* atcdata.cfg
* fxcmdata.cfg

... More than 20

Please note, every LP(liquidity provider) has different spreads, financing interests and commissions. You need to set the parameters according to the actual conditions.

### util.cfg is the configuration file.

We will post some guide to teach you how to set up the configuration file soon.
